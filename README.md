# Project Overview
The goal of this project is for me to learn the basics of **Object Oriented Programming** and some **Java** syntax.
The code is, naturally, way far from clean and efficient since it's one of the first few programs I wrote back when I started learning how to code in 2016.  But I think we all have to start somewhere and I would hence like to keep this repo public for future improvements.
This program is designed to act exactly the same as the famous **game 2048**. 
It basically gives you a board and let you move around tiles with vales(powers of 2) on it. 
When two adjacent tiles with the same value move in the given direction, the tiles would combine and merge into one tile. 
You will earn score every time you merge two tiles.

# Language

This program is written in **Java**
  

# How to play 
  Build the project with IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** and run **Gui2048.java** to play with the game with graphic user interface.
  You can also run **Game2048.java** and play the game on the command line (with instructions provided)
